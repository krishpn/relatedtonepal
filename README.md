# Title: Beyond the Numbers: Causal Effects of Financial Report Sentiment on Bank Profitability 
This study establishes the causal effects of market sentiment on firm profitability, moving beyond traditional correlational analyses. It leverages a causal forest machine learning methodol-
 ogy to control for numerous confounding variables, enabling systematic analysis of heterogeneity

9 and non-linearities often overlooked. A key innovation is the use of a pre-trained FinancialBERT

10 to generate sentiment scores from quarterly reports, which are then treated as causal interven-
11 tions impacting profitability dynamics like returns and volatilities. Utilizing a comprehensive

12 dataset from NEPSE, NRB, and individual financial institutions, the research employs SHAP
13 analysis to identify influential profit predictors. A two-pronged causal analysis further explores
14 how sentimentâ€™s impact is conditioned by Loan Portfolio/Asset Composition and Balance Sheet
15 Strength/Leverage. Average Treatment Effect analyses, combined with SHAP insights, reveal

16 statistically significant causal associations between certain balance sheet and expense manage-
17 ment variables and profitability. This advanced causal machine learning framework significantly

18 extends existing literature, providing a more robust understanding of how financial sentiment
19 truly impacts firm performance.
